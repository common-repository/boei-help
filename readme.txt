**Why you need Boei**

Email and phone are no longer the preferred channels of communication.
Chat and messaging have become the natural way we connect in our private lives. And customers want to talk to businesses the same way they do with friends and family.

70% of consumers prefer messaging apps like Telegram and live chats over any other form of communication.

Give them options with Boei.

Bring all your contact channels to one location with the Boei Supermenu.
And engage with your clients using their preferred channel.

**Don't miss out on potential customers who prefer to talk to your business via:**

1. Messaging apps like Telegram, Signal, WeChat, Slack, Skype, Discord‚Ä¶
2. Social DMs like Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn‚Ä¶
3. Chat integrations like Tawk, Jivochat, Drift, Intercom, Crisp‚Ä¶
4. AI Chatbot for instant, 24/7 support

Let your visitors choose ‚Ä¶ and collect many more leads every day.

**Click to chat: All the chat options in one button!**

Once you use Boei, your visitors are always just one click away from talking to you. Show what channels you're available on, and let them choose their favorite apps or channels. Provide a click-to-call button, email button, SMS button, Viber button, or many more, so you never lose a lead again.

üìà **More Conversions: Get 30% more leads and calls.**

If you offer channels like Telegram and others, you can convert up to 30% more visitors into leads.

üëã **Zero friction**: **Meet your customers where they are.**

Let your customers chat with you in a way that feels easy and natural to them. Give them options to choose their favorite apps. Include Social Media DMs like Twitter and Snapchat, and many other chat channels.

üôéüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Relationship**: **Build trust and personal connections**

Surveys prove that people experience direct messaging as much more personal and feel better about brands after messaging with them. Using Boei will immediately help you build trust and create better connections.

üí¨ **Natural selling: Keep the conversation going and close the sale.**

Keep in contact with visitors after they leave your website and increase conversions by building a relationship. Just continue to chat with them. Direct messaging has the highest conversion rates you will ever experience.

**üèÜ Support 2.0: Improve your support and service**

Boei will add a floating chat assistant to any page of your website. If you like, you can configure a different widget for any page of your site. Add text and video to showcase products or answer important questions. Or include maps to direct customers to your store.

**ü§ñ AI-Powered Support: Always available, instant responses**

With our new AI Chatbot, provide instant support to your visitors 24/7. The chatbot can handle common queries, guide users through your site, and even assist with basic troubleshooting, freeing up your human support team for more complex issues.

**Why Boei is better than live chat alone.**

People often prefer messaging apps like Telegram over regular customer support chat. Regular live chats will leave your clients tethered to the computer to wait for your answer. When you let your visitors contact you through Viber, Telegram, etc., they are free to chat with you at any time, wherever they go. And you are too. By offering more options, your visitors are much more likely to contact you.

**Boei Telegram integration for WordPress**

Telegram is one of the most used messaging apps worldwide. With Boei you can integrate Telegram with WordPress in a matter of seconds. Just enter your Telegram username, and you're ready to go. Clicking on the Telegram button will take your visitor directly to the app, and they can type their message. You will then receive it on your own Telegram account, and you can reply from wherever you are.

**Integrate Boei with Jivochat and Crisp**

Services like Jivochat and Crisp offer a shared inbox for many of your contact channels. Unfortunately, they miss several important ones. With Boei, you can seamlessly integrate Jivochat and Crisp in your Supermenu and supplement it with those services they don't natively support. Much better than cluttering your design with more buttons.

**Bikram Singh**

‚Äú**Boei is a must-have for every website.** The chat tool is adaptable for most businesses, easy to set up and encourages responses immediately. And with excellent support from Ruben, you can't go wrong with Boei!‚Äù
**elgaw**

‚Äú**Very happy to give 5 Stars for this plugin.** Over 70% of my business inquiries are coming from smartphone users based on my Google Analytics. Boei allows those users to contact me on their preferred social channel with one click‚Ä¶‚Äù
**Fran Tully**

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs working very well! **I started to make sales right after I installed this.**‚Äù
**Ibrahim**

‚Äú**Boei is chatting with customers on steroids.** It resolves a huge problem ‚Äì how to integrate all the channels people use to communicate in one place. In addition, there is an option for newsletter subscription integration. Even a contact form. Brilliant. The support is great and Ruben (the developer) is listening to his clients. Highly recommend.‚Äù
**Bobby K**

‚ÄúHow is this possible? I have been searching for a service like Boei, without success for over a year. Boei just works. It works so well I was suspicious of it for nearly a whole week, sending endless texts and emails to myself in utter disbelief when it failed to keel over!

Setup is straightforward, easy, and takes minutes.

**Seriously, I cannot recommend Boei enough.**‚Äù
**Sara Hall**

#### **How does it work?**

Boei will add a floating chat button to your website. Clicking on it will open a beautifully styled chat menu where you can choose to display buttons for Viber calls, Skype calls, Telegram chat, and many more as contact options for your website.

Customers can select their preferred channel to contact you. Don‚Äôt miss any more leads because the customer didn‚Äôt want to mail you. Instead, visitors can quickly contact you via Viber, Slack, Telegram, social media DMs, or any other channel you offer.

Boei can also integrate with several live chat solutions (Jivochat, Crisp, Tawk.to, and many more) and provide them as channels to your customers.

Boei comes with several built-in forms: free contact form, newsletter signup form, feedback form, and callback form.

On top of that, you can integrate videos, images, HTML code, and iframes to personalize your chat menu and give your visitors a warm welcome.

Jivochat is a contact CRM to bring your many contact channels into one location for centralized customer support or sales. With Boei, you can seamlessly integrate Jivochat with many other services it does not natively support.

### Crisp Chat - an all-in-one business messaging platform

Crisp Chat is another centralized inbox for various contact channels. With Boei, you can seamlessly integrate Crisp Chat with other channels it doesn‚Äôt natively support.

### Snapchat, Twitter, and LinkedIn DMs - the mandatory social media channels

When younger people exchange contacts, it‚Äôs not emails anymore. It‚Äôs either LinkedIn, Snapchat, or Twitter handles. Meet your audience where they naturally connect by integrating Twitter, LinkedIn, and Snapchat in your Boei widgets.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why do I need a Boei Account?**

In contrast to many bloated chat widgets that slow down your website and delay the page load, Boei is designed to be super lightweight. That is why all the heavy lifting is done on Boei servers, and the WordPress Plugin just serves as a bridge. This way, only minimal queries and processes need to be done by WordPress itself, and your website stays lightning-fast. A second benefit of this architecture is that Boei can easily be used across all platforms because all the configurations are done directly in your Boei account. This is better for you and us because it means we don't have to reinvent the Boei admin area for every CMS on Earth.

**Do I need a paid subscription?**

No, you can use Boei for free. You only need a free account, and you can create one at [Boei.help](https://www.boei.help/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=pluginpage). You can upgrade Boei to a premium version with additional features and websites, but that is not required. With the free version, you can use all channels such as Viber, Slack, Telegram, and more.

**Where can I find the documentation and features?**

See our [documentation here](https://boei.help/docs?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=pluginpage).

**What about privacy or GDPR?**

Boei is cookie-free and GDPR-compliant. Boei does not set or use cookies, so you don't need a cookie bar. Also, Boei only saves anonymous data for your statistics.

**What is the Boei AI Chatbot?**

The Boei AI Chatbot is our latest feature that provides intelligent, automated responses to your visitors' queries. It can handle common questions, guide users through your website, and offer support 24/7. This AI-powered assistant helps reduce your support team's workload while ensuring your visitors always get quick responses.

**Are there any other useful plugins from the same maker?**

Yes, the makers of Boei have developed several other WordPress plugins that can enhance your website's functionality:

1. [WordPress Roadmap Plugin](https://www.productlift.dev/roadmap/wordpress): Showcase your product roadmap and gather user feedback.
2. [WordPress Changelog Plugin](https://www.productlift.dev/changelog/wordpress): Display your product updates and changes beautifully.
